The Fruit Classification and Calorie Counter Web App is 
designed to provide an efficient way to classify different
fruit types and estimate their calorie content. By leveraging 
deep learning algorithms, particularly a pre-trained ResNet50 model,
the app can accurately identify fruit from images, making it highly
useful for dietary tracking and health-conscious users. The application
goes beyond simple classification by offering calorie information, 
helping users make informed decisions about their fruit consumption.

This project addresses the growing need for accessible tools 
that aid in health management, specifically for individuals
focused on tracking their caloric intake. It integrates image
processing and web scraping techniques to fetch accurate calorie
data, providing a seamless experience for users. The importance 
of this app lies in its potential to assist users in leading
healthier lifestyles through technology, making it a valuable
tool in the fields of nutrition and dietary analysis.
